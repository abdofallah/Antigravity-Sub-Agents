## Why?

Alot of us are disappointed in the approach google has taken for 2.0... it could just have been as simple as this than a standalone manager and disconnected IDE.

## What Is This?

Antigravity Sub-Agents is a VS Code extension that gives Antigravity IDE's AI agents the ability to **spawn child agents** that work in parallel. A parent agent can launch multiple sub-agents, each with their own conversation, and receive consolidated results when they finish.

**Example:** A parent agent tasked with "refactor this codebase" can launch three sub-agents — one to refactor the auth module, one for the database layer, and one to update tests — all running simultaneously.

## Features

- **🚀 Parallel Execution** — Launch up to 20 sub-agents at once, each in its own conversation.
- **🧠 Multi-Model** — Choose per-agent models: Gemini Flash, Pro, Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT.
- **📊 Real-Time Status** — Live status panel injected into the Agent Manager sidebar via CDP.
- **🔒 Chat Locking** — Sub-agent chats are view-only; users interact through the parent.
- **🔄 Auto-Delivery** — Results are automatically delivered to the parent when all agents finish.
- **⏹ Cancel Control** — Stop individual agents, all agents, or silently terminate without reporting.
- **🔌 MCP Integration** — Exposes tools via Model Context Protocol so agents can spawn sub-agents programmatically.
- **⚙️ Configurable** — Default model, CDP port, auto-connect, auto-install settings.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Download the latest `.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/abdofallah/Antigravity-Sub-Agents/releases) and install:

```
Antigravity IDE → Extensions → ⋯ → Install from VSIX...
```

### 2. Enable CDP (for sidebar injection)

Launch Antigravity with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled:

```bash
# Windows
Antigravity.exe --remote-debugging-port=9347

# Or set permanently
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS", "--remote-debugging-port=9347", "User")
```

> **Tip:** Use the command palette: `Sub-Agents: Setup CDP` for guided setup.

### 3. MCP Config (auto-installed)

The extension automatically writes the MCP server config on first activation. If needed, verify in `Manage MCPs`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "subagents": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["<extension-path>/mcp-server.js"],
            "env": { "SUBAGENTS_BRIDGE_PORT": "<port>" }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Use It

Once configured, any Antigravity agent can use the sub-agents tools:

```
Agent: "I'll launch 3 sub-agents to work on this in parallel..."
→ Calls: launch_subagents({ tasks: [...], model: "flash" })
→ 3 sub-agents start working
→ Results delivered automatically to the parent
```

## Architecture

```
Parent Agent ──► MCP Bridge ──► Orchestrator ──► Language Server
                                    │
                        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
                        ▼           ▼           ▼
                   Sub-Agent 1  Sub-Agent 2  Sub-Agent 3
                        │           │           │
                        └───────────┼───────────┘
                                    ▼
                           Batch Report → Parent
```

npm install
npm run build    # Build + tests (24 CDP smoke tests)
npm run dev      # Watch mode (rebuilds on changes)
npm run test     # Run tests only
```
